        <b>Lorem Ipsum </b>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
        Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of
        type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
        leap
        into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
        <i>release of Letraset </i>sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
